On this repo we have all the exercises that I've done from the "Java Programming" MOOC.fi made by the University of Helsinki. 

The course explains the concepts very clearly. I can see some progress at this first stage. Looking forward to complete Java Programming II!

# My thoughts on the course
I started 23th May 2021 and on 06th June 2021, I completed the Java Programming I of the MOOC.fi. At first, it covered logic basics that I was familiar with, as I had previously studied programming logic years ago. Afterwards, the MOOC.fi proceeds to introduce more complex concepts. The course is certainly solid and simple to understand. Although some exercises seem tricky to solve, it teaches the concepts in a well-structured manner and I was able to grasp that information after all.

Here's my certificate for Java Programming I.

I forgot to update you that on 19 July 2021 I finished Java Programming II. Here's my certificate for Java Programming II, and you can found both courses exercise solutions in this repo. Keep mind that you must of all first try to solve problem without help to improve your solving problem skills.
