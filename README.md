On this repo we have all the exercises that I've done from the "Object Oriented Programming with Java" MOOC made by the University of Helsinki. 

The course explains the concepts very clearly. I can see some progress at this first stage. Looking forward to complete part 2!

# My thoughts on the course
On 06th June, I completed the first part of the MOOC. At first, it covered logic basics that I was familiar with, as I had previously studied programming logic years ago. Afterwards, the MOOc proceeds to introduce more complex concepts. The course is certainly solid and simple to understand. Although some exercises seem tricky to solve, it teaches the concepts in a well-structured manner and I was able to grasp that information after all.

Here's my certificate for part 1.

I'll keep updating this until I complete part 2.
